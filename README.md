# Ergodox EZ layout

My Ergodox EZ layout. It's the nth iteration of the layout that I've been using for the duration of my usage of the ergodox. I've also meddled with having the modifiers on the home row as long press keys, but it turns out that it was impossible to find a timeout that would actually work for all key combinations, and especially all days (weirdly enough).

At this point, branched off from using the graphical configuration at [https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/layouts/0DX4/latest/0] to maintain this as source code instead. Also to be able to add more features (like the keylogger) that just isn't possible to do with the graphical one.

## Building

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware.git
$ cd qmk_firmware
$ git clone https://github.com/callebjorkell/ergodox-layout.git keyboards/ergodox_ez/keymaps/callebjorkell
$ make keyboard=ergodox_ez keymap=callebjorkell
```

Then install with teensy loader, same as for the files generated by the graphical configurator.
